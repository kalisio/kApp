# About

The **kApp** (i.e. KDK-based Application) is a demonstration application created from the [skeleton](https://kalisio.github.io/skeleton/), which includes all the necessary boilerplate that you need to get started building your application with the [Kalisio Development Kit](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/).

It also includes the minimum viable set of features to start:
* a [basic application layout](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/components.html) including side navigation, application bar, right panel and various widgets
* ready-to-go [user authentication services](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/services.html#users-service) and [screens](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/components.html#authentication),
* a [basic service](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/application.html) to create/remove documents in database,
* a [basic collection activity](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/mixins.html) listing documents using either [a list, a grid or a table](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/components.html#collections),
* a [basic editor](https://kalisio.github.io/kdk/api/core/components.html#editors) to fill document properties when creating a new document.

It aims at providing a basic example to setup the application server, the client build, the continuous integration and testing, as well as running use cases of KDK components.
